# Routes

`routes/web.php` contains a small set of routes for the demo:

- `GET /` — redirects to `/kinematics` for convenience in development
- `GET /kinematics` — returns the `kinematics` Blade view

If you add new views or server-driven endpoints, document them here and update `README.md` accordingly.
